# Sapien

Mindmaps for seamless brainstorming and collaboration. Starting with the reading experience.

## Goal

I love reading. However, I find it very difficult to both read in depth and share insights conveniently with friends. Kindle and physical books are structured to allow the reader to enter the flow, whereas WeChat Books and blogs are designed to making sharing seamless, but neither are natively suited for both purposes.

As a result, I have been thinking to create a series of non-disruptive tool integrations to Kindle, in order to significantly reduce the activation energy for sharing and synthesis activities during or after in-depth reading. This vision has given birth to [Allumer](https://github.com/Yijia-Chen/allumer), an also-in-progress app for exporting and formatting Kindle highlights and notes, and this one.

## Progress

2 / 10.

Right now, there is an Xmind-like mind map creation tool with Notion-like document tree, whose combination is already superior to both tools for my mind map purposes. UI is far from great yet and needs to allow more style customization.

One major feature that I have yet to implement is sharing and real-time collaboration.

## How to Use

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), hence all commands that come with a React App are ready at your disposal.

To start the project in development mode, first configure your env file based on `.env.template`, and then simply run `yarn start` in the project directory. Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser. The page automatically reloads for every edit you make locally.
